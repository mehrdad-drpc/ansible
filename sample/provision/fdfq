       All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at _/.  These files can be spread out over several devices.  The mmoouunntt command serves
       to attach the filesystem found on some device to the big file tree.  Conversely, the uummoouunntt(8) command will detach it again.  The filesystem is used to control how data is  stored
       on the device or provided in a virtual way by network or another services.

       The standard form of the mmoouunntt command is:

              mmoouunntt --tt _t_y_p_e _d_e_v_i_c_e _d_i_r

       This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on _d_e_v_i_c_e (which is of type _t_y_p_e) at the directory _d_i_r.  The option --tt _t_y_p_e is optional.  The mmoouunntt command is usually able to
       detect a filesystem.  The root permissions are necessary to mount a filesystem by default.  See section "Non-superuser mounts" below for more details.  The previous  contents  (if
       any) and owner and mode of _d_i_r become invisible, and as long as this filesystem remains mounted, the pathname _d_i_r refers to the root of the filesystem on _d_e_v_i_c_e.

       If only the directory or the device is given, for example:

              mmoouunntt //ddiirr

       then mmoouunntt looks for a mountpoint (and if not found then for a device) in the _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b file.  It's possible to use the ----ttaarrggeett or ----ssoouurrccee options to avoid ambivalent interpre‐
       tation of the given argument.  For example:

              mmoouunntt ----ttaarrggeett //mmoouunnttppooiinntt

       The same filesystem may be mounted more than once, and in some cases (e.g.  network filesystems) the same filesystem may be mounted on the same mountpoint more  times.  The  mount
       command  does  not  implement  any  policy to control this behavior. All behavior is controlled bythe  kernel and it is usually specific to the filesystem driver. The exception is
       ----aallll, in this case already mounted filesystems are ignored (see ----aallll below for more details).

       The following command lists all mounted filesystems (of type _t_y_p_e):

       The option --ll adds labels to this listing.  See below.

       Most devices are indicated by a filename (of a block special device), like _/_d_e_v_/_s_d_a_1, but there are other possibilities.  For example, in the case of an NFS mount, _d_e_v_i_c_e may look
       like  _k_n_u_t_h_._c_w_i_._n_l_:_/_d_i_r.   It  is  also possible to indicate a block special device using its filesystem label or UUID (see the --LL and --UU options below), or its partition label or
       UUID.  Partition identifiers are supported for example for GUID Partition Tables (GPT).

       The device name of disk partitions are unstable; hardware reconfiguration, adding or removing a device can cause change in names. This is reason why it's strongly  recommended  to
       use filesystem or partition identificators like UUID or LABEL.

       The  command  llssbbllkk  ----ffss  provides overview of filesystems, LABELs and UUIDs on available block devices.  The command bbllkkiidd --pp <<ddeevviiccee>> provides details about a filesystem on the
       specified device.

       Don't forget that there is no guarantee that UUIDs and labels are really unique, especially if you move, share or copy the device.  Use llssbbllkk --oo ++UUUUIIDD,,PPAARRTTUUUUIIDD to verify that  the
       UUIDs are really unique in your system.

       The  recommended  setup is to use tags (e.g. UUUUIIDD==_u_u_i_d) rather than _/_d_e_v_/_d_i_s_k_/_b_y_-_{_l_a_b_e_l_,_u_u_i_d_,_p_a_r_t_u_u_i_d_,_p_a_r_t_l_a_b_e_l_} udev symlinks in the _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b file.  Tags are more readable, ro‐
       bust and portable.  The mmoouunntt(8) command internally uses udev symlinks, so the use of symlinks in /etc/fstab has no advantage over tags.  For more details see lliibbbbllkkiidd(3).

       Note that mmoouunntt(8) uses UUIDs as strings.  The UUIDs from the command line or from ffssttaabb(5) are not converted to internal binary representation.  The string representation of  the
       UUID should be based on lower case characters.

       The  _p_r_o_c filesystem is not associated with a special device, and when mounting it, an arbitrary keyword, such as _p_r_o_c can be used instead of a device specification.  (The custom‐
       ary choice _n_o_n_e is less fortunate: the error message `none already mounted' from mmoouunntt can be confusing.)

       The file _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b (see ffssttaabb(5)), may contain lines describing what devices are usually mounted where, using which options.  The default location of the  ffssttaabb(5)  file  can  be
       overridden with the ----ffssttaabb _p_a_t_h command-line option (see below for more details).

       The command

              mmoouunntt --aa [--tt _t_y_p_e] [--OO _o_p_t_l_i_s_t]

       (usually  given  in  a bootscript) causes all filesystems mentioned in _f_s_t_a_b (of the proper type and/or having or not having the proper options) to be mounted as indicated, except
       for those whose line contains the nnooaauuttoo keyword.  Adding the --FF option will make mmoouunntt fork, so that the filesystems are mounted simultaneously.

       When mounting a filesystem mentioned in _f_s_t_a_b or _m_t_a_b, it suffices to specify on the command line only the device, or only the mount point.

       The programs mmoouunntt and uummoouunntt traditionally maintained a list of currently mounted filesystems in the file _/_e_t_c_/_m_t_a_b.  The support for regular classic _/_e_t_c_/_m_t_a_b is completely dis‐
       abled  in compile time by default, because on current Linux systems it is better to make it a symlink to _/_p_r_o_c_/_m_o_u_n_t_s instead. The regular mtab file maintained in userspace cannot
       reliably work with namespaces, containers and other advanced Linux features.  If the regular mtab support is enabled than it's possible to use the file as well as the symlink.

       If no arguments are given to mmoouunntt, the list of mounted filesystems is printed.

       If you want to override mount options from _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b you have to use the --oo option:

              mmoouunntt _d_e_v_i_c_e|_d_i_r --oo _o_p_t_i_o_n_s

       and then the mount options from the command line will be appended to the list of options from _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b.  This default behaviour is possible to  change  by  command  line  option
       ----ooppttiioonnss--mmooddee.  The usual behavior is that the last option wins if there are conflicting ones.

       The mmoouunntt program does not read the _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b file if both _d_e_v_i_c_e (or LABEL, UUID, PARTUUID or PARTLABEL) and _d_i_r are specified.  For example, to mount device ffoooo at //ddiirr:

              mmoouunntt //ddeevv//ffoooo //ddiirr

       This default behaviour is possible to change by command line option ----ooppttiioonnss--ssoouurrccee--ffoorrccee to always read configuration from fstab. For non-root users mmoouunntt always read fstab con‐
       figuration.

   NNoonn--ssuuppeerruusseerr mmoouunnttss
       Normally, only the superuser can mount filesystems.  However, when _f_s_t_a_b contains the uusseerr option on a line, anybody can mount the corresponding filesystem.

       Thus, given a line

              //ddeevv//ccddrroomm  //ccdd  iissoo99666600  rroo,,uusseerr,,nnooaauuttoo,,uunnhhiiddee

       any user can mount the iso9660 filesystem found on an inserted CDROM using the command:
              mmoouunntt //ccdd

       Note that mmoouunntt is very strict about non-root users and all paths specified on command line are verified before fstab is parsed or a helper program is executed. It's strongly rec‐
       ommended to use a valid mountpoint to specify filesystem, otherwise mmoouunntt may fail. For example it's bad idea to use NFS or CIFS source on command line.

       For  more  details,  see  ffssttaabb(5).  Only the user that mounted a filesystem can unmount it again.  If any user should be able to unmount it, then use uusseerrss instead of uusseerr in the
       _f_s_t_a_b line.  The oowwnneerr option is similar to the uusseerr option, with the restriction that the user must be the owner of the special file.  This may be useful e.g. for  _/_d_e_v_/_f_d  if  a
       login script makes the console user owner of this device.  The ggrroouupp option is similar, with the restriction that the user must be member of the group of the special file.

   BBiinndd mmoouunntt ooppeerraattiioonn
       Remount part of the file hierarchy somewhere else.  The call is:

              mmoouunntt ----bbiinndd _o_l_d_d_i_r _n_e_w_d_i_r

       or by using this fstab entry:

              //_o_l_d_d_i_r //_n_e_w_d_i_r nnoonnee bbiinndd

       After this call the same contents are accessible in two places.

       It is important to understand that "bind" does not to create any second-class or special node in the kernel VFS. The "bind" is just another operation to attach a filesystem. There
       is nowhere stored information that the filesystem has been attached by "bind" operation. The _o_l_d_d_i_r and _n_e_w_d_i_r are independent and the _o_l_d_d_i_r may be umounted.

       One can also remount a single file (on a single file).  It's also possible to use the bind mount to create a mountpoint from a regular directory, for example:

              mmoouunntt ----bbiinndd ffoooo ffoooo

       The bind mount call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem, not possible submounts.  The entire file hierarchy including submounts is attached a second place by using:

              mmoouunntt ----rrbbiinndd _o_l_d_d_i_r _n_e_w_d_i_r

       Note that the filesystem mount options maintained by kernel will remain the same as those on the original mount point.  The userspace mount options  (e.g.  _netdev)  will  not  be
       copied by mmoouunntt(8) and it's necessary explicitly specify the options on mount command line.

       mmoouunntt(8) since v2.27 allows to change the mount options by passing the relevant options along with ----bbiinndd.  For example:

              mmoouunntt --oo bbiinndd,,rroo ffoooo ffoooo

       This feature is not supported by the Linux kernel; it is implemented in userspace by an additional mmoouunntt(2) remounting system call.  This solution is not atomic.

       The alternative (classic) way to create a read-only bind mount is to use the remount operation, for example:

              mmoouunntt ----bbiinndd _o_l_d_d_i_r _n_e_w_d_i_r
              mmoouunntt --oo rreemmoouunntt,,bbiinndd,,rroo _o_l_d_d_i_r _n_e_w_d_i_r

       Note that a read-only bind will create a read-only mountpoint (VFS entry), but the original filesystem superblock will still be writable, meaning that the _o_l_d_d_i_r will be writable,
       but the _n_e_w_d_i_r will be read-only.

       It's also possible to change nosuid, nodev, noexec, noatime, nodiratime and relatime VFS entry flags by "remount,bind" operation.  The another  (for  example  filesystem  specific
       flags) are silently ignored.  It's impossible to change mount options recursively (for example with --oo rrbbiinndd,,rroo).

       mmoouunntt(8)  since  v2.31  ignores the bbiinndd flag from _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b on rreemmoouunntt ooppeerraattiioonn (if "-o remount" specified on command line). This is necessary to fully control mount options on
       remount by command line. In the previous versions the bind flag has been always applied and it was impossible to re-define mount options without interaction with the  bind  seman‐
       tic. This mmoouunntt(8) behavior does not affect situations when "remount,bind" is specified in the _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b file.

   TThhee mmoovvee ooppeerraattiioonn
       Move a mmoouunntteedd ttrreeee to another place (atomically).  The call is:

              mmoouunntt ----mmoovvee _o_l_d_d_i_r _n_e_w_d_i_r

       This will cause the contents which previously appeared under _o_l_d_d_i_r to now be accessible under _n_e_w_d_i_r.  The physical location of the files is not changed.  Note that _o_l_d_d_i_r has to
       be a mountpoint.

       Note also that moving a mount residing under a shared mount is invalid and unsupported.  Use ffiinnddmmnntt --oo TTAARRGGEETT,,PPRROOPPAAGGAATTIIOONN to see the current propagation flags.

       Since Linux 2.6.15 it is possible to mark a mount and its submounts as shared, private, slave or unbindable.  A shared mount provides the ability to create mirrors of  that  mount
       such  that  mounts  and unmounts within any of the mirrors propagate to the other mirror.  A slave mount receives propagation from its master, but not vice versa.  A private mount
       carries no propagation abilities.  An unbindable mount is a private mount which cannot be cloned through a bind operation.  The detailed semantics  are  documented  in  _D_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_a_‐
       _t_i_o_n_/_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_s_/_s_h_a_r_e_d_s_u_b_t_r_e_e_._t_x_t file in the kernel source tree.

       Supported operations are:

              mmoouunntt ----mmaakkee--sshhaarreedd _m_o_u_n_t_p_o_i_n_t

       The following commands allow one to recursively change the type of all the mounts under a given mountpoint.

       Note that the Linux kernel does not allow to change multiple propagation flags with a single mmoouunntt(2) system call, and the flags cannot be mixed with other mount options and oper‐
       ations.

       Since util-linux 2.23 the mmoouunntt command allows to do more propagation (topology) changes by one mount(8) call and do it also together with other mount operations.  This feature is
       EXPERIMENTAL.   The  propagation flags are applied by additional mmoouunntt(2) system calls when the preceding mount operations were successful.  Note that this use case is not atomic.
       It is possible to specify the propagation flags in ffssttaabb(5) as mount options (pprriivvaattee, ssllaavvee, sshhaarreedd, uunnbbiinnddaabbllee, rrpprriivvaattee, rrssllaavvee, rrsshhaarreedd, rruunnbbiinnddaabbllee).

       For example:

              mmoouunntt ----mmaakkee--pprriivvaattee ----mmaakkee--uunnbbiinnddaabbllee //ddeevv//ssddaa11 //ffoooo

       is the same as:

              mmoouunntt //ddeevv//ssddaa11 //ffooooxx
              mmoouunntt ----mmaakkee--pprriivvaattee //ffoooo
              mmoouunntt ----mmaakkee--uunnbbiinnddaabbllee //ffoooo

CCOOMMMMAANNDD--LLIINNEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The full set of mount options used by an invocation of mmoouunntt is determined by first extracting the mount options for the filesystem from the _f_s_t_a_b table, then applying any options
       specified by the --oo argument, and finally applying a --rr or --ww option, when present.

       The command mmoouunntt does not pass all command-line options to the //ssbbiinn//mmoouunntt.._s_u_f_f_i_x mount helpers.  The interface between mmoouunntt and the mount helpers is described below in the sec‐
       tion EEXXTTEERRNNAALL HHEELLPPEERRSS.

       Command-line options available for the mmoouunntt command are:

       --aa, ----aallll
              Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in _f_s_t_a_b (except for those whose line contains the nnooaauuttoo keyword).  The filesystems are mounted following their  order
              in  _f_s_t_a_b.   The mount command compares filesystem source, target (and fs root for bind mount or btrfs) to detect already mounted filesystems. The kernel table with already
              mounted filesystems is cached during mmoouunntt ----aallll. It means that all duplicated fstab entries will be mounted.

              The option ----aallll is possible to use for remount operation too. In this case all filters (--tt and --OO) are applied to the table of already mounted filesystems.

              Note that it is a bad practice to use mmoouunntt --aa for _f_s_t_a_b checking. The recommended solution is ffiinnddmmnntt ----vveerriiffyy.

       --BB, ----bbiinndd
              Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are available in both places).  See above, under BBiinndd mmoouunnttss.

       --cc, ----nnoo--ccaannoonniiccaalliizzee
              Don't canonicalize paths.  The mount command canonicalizes all paths (from command line or fstab) by default.  This option can be used together with the --ff flag for already
              canonicalized  absolute  paths.   The  option  is designed for mount helpers which call mmoouunntt --ii.  It is strongly recommended to not use this command-line option for normal
              mount operations.

              Note that mmoouunntt(8) does not pass this option to the //ssbbiinn//mmoouunntt.._t_y_p_e helpers.

       --FF, ----ffoorrkk
              (Used in conjunction with --aa.)  Fork off a new incarnation of mmoouunntt for each device.  This will do the mounts on different devices or different  NFS  servers  in  parallel.
              This  has  the advantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts go in parallel.  A disadvantage is that the mounts are done in undefined order.  Thus, you cannot use this op‐
              tion if you want to mount both _/_u_s_r and _/_u_s_r_/_s_p_o_o_l.

       --ff,, ----ffaakkee
              Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; if it's not obvious, this ``fakes'' mounting the filesystem.  This option is useful in conjunction with  the
              --vv  flag  to  determine what the mmoouunntt command is trying to do.  It can also be used to add entries for devices that were mounted earlier with the --nn option.  The --ff option
              checks for an existing record in /etc/mtab and fails when the record already exists (with a regular non-fake mount, this check is done by the kernel).

       --ii,, ----iinntteerrnnaall--oonnllyy
              Don't call the //ssbbiinn//mmoouunntt.._f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m helper even if it exists.

       --LL, ----llaabbeell _l_a_b_e_l
              Mount the partition that has the specified _l_a_b_e_l.

       --ll, ----sshhooww--llaabbeellss
              Add the labels in the mount output.  mmoouunntt must have permission to read the disk device (e.g. be set-user-ID root) for this to work.  One can set such  a  label  for  ext2,
              ext3 or ext4 using the ee22llaabbeell(8) utility, or for XFS using xxffss__aaddmmiinn(8), or for reiserfs using rreeiisseerrffssttuunnee(8).

       --MM, ----mmoovvee
              Move a subtree to some other place.  See above, the subsection TThhee mmoovvee ooppeerraattiioonn.

       --nn, ----nnoo--mmttaabb
              Mount without writing in _/_e_t_c_/_m_t_a_b.  This is necessary for example when _/_e_t_c is on a read-only filesystem.

       --NN, ----nnaammeessppaaccee _n_s
              Perform mount in namespace specified by _n_s.  _n_s is either PID of process running in that namespace or special file representing that namespace.

              mmoouunntt(8)  switches  to  the namespace when it reads /etc/fstab, writes /etc/mtab (or writes to /run/mount) and calls mmoouunntt(2) system call, otherwise it runs in the original
              namespace. It means that the target namespace does not have to contain any libraries or another requirements necessary to execute mmoouunntt(2) command.

              See nnaammeessppaacceess(7) for more information.

       --OO, ----tteesstt--ooppttss _o_p_t_s
              Limit the set of filesystems to which the --aa option applies.  In this regard it is like the --tt option except that --OO is useless without --aa.  For example, the command:

                     mmoouunntt --aa --OO nnoo__nneettddeevv

              mounts all filesystems except those which have the option ___n_e_t_d_e_v specified in the options field in the _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b file.

              It is different from --tt in that each option is matched exactly; a leading nnoo at the beginning of one option does not negate the rest.

              The --tt and --OO options are cumulative in effect; that is, the command

                     mmoouunntt --aa --tt eexxtt22 --OO __nneettddeevv

              mounts all ext2 filesystems with the _netdev option, not all filesystems that are either ext2 or have the _netdev option specified.

       --oo, ----ooppttiioonnss _o_p_t_s
              Use the specified mount options.  The _o_p_t_s argument is a comma-separated list.  For example:

                     mmoouunntt LLAABBEELL==mmyyddiisskk --oo nnooaattiimmee,,nnooddeevv,,nnoossuuiidd

              For more details, see the FFIILLEESSYYSSTTEEMM--IINNDDEEPPEENNDDEENNTT MMOOUUNNTT OOPPTTIIOONNSS and FFIILLEESSYYSSTTEEMM--SSPPEECCIIFFIICC MMOOUUNNTT OOPPTTIIOONNSS sections.

       ----ooppttiioonnss--mmooddee _m_o_d_e
              Controls how to combine options from fstab/mtab with options from command line.  _m_o_d_e can be one of iiggnnoorree, aappppeenndd, pprreeppeenndd or rreeppllaaccee.  For example aappppeenndd means  that  op‐
              tions  from  fstab  are  appended to options from command line.  Default value is pprreeppeenndd -- it means command line options are evaluated after fstab options.  Note that the
              last option wins if there are conflicting ones.

       ----ooppttiioonnss--ssoouurrccee _s_o_u_r_c_e
              Source of default options.  _s_o_u_r_c_e is comma separated list of ffssttaabb, mmttaabb and ddiissaabbllee.  ddiissaabbllee disables ffssttaabb and mmttaabb and disables ----ooppttiioonnss--ssoouurrccee--ffoorrccee.  Default  value
              is ffssttaabb,,mmttaabb.

       ----ooppttiioonnss--ssoouurrccee--ffoorrccee
              Use options from fstab/mtab even if both _d_e_v_i_c_e and _d_i_r are specified.

       --RR, ----rrbbiinndd
              Remount a subtree and all possible submounts somewhere else (so that its contents are available in both places).  See above, the subsection BBiinndd mmoouunnttss.

       --rr, ----rreeaadd--oonnllyy
              Mount the filesystem read-only.  A synonym is --oo rroo.

              Note that, depending on the filesystem type, state and kernel behavior, the system may still write to the device.  For example, ext3 and ext4 will replay the journal if the
              filesystem is dirty.  To prevent this kind of write access, you may want to mount an ext3 or ext4 filesystem with the rroo,,nnoollooaadd mount options or set the block device itself
              to read-only mode, see the bblloocckkddeevv(8) command.

       --ss     Tolerate  sloppy mount options rather than failing.  This will ignore mount options not supported by a filesystem type.  Not all filesystems support this option.  Currently
              it's supported by the mmoouunntt..nnffss mount helper only.

       ----ssoouurrccee _d_e_v_i_c_e
              If only one argument for the mount command is given then the argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source (device).  This option allows to explicitly  de‐
              fine that the argument is the mount source.

       ----ttaarrggeett _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              If  only one argument for the mount command is given then the argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source (device).  This option allows to explicitly de‐
              fine that the argument is the mount target.

       --TT, ----ffssttaabb _p_a_t_h
              Specifies an alternative fstab file.  If _p_a_t_h is a directory then the files in the directory are sorted by ssttrrvveerrssccmmpp(3); files that start with "." or without an .fstab ex‐
              tension  are  ignored.  The option can be specified more than once.  This option is mostly designed for initramfs or chroot scripts where additional configuration is speci‐
              fied beyond standard system configuration.

              Note that mmoouunntt(8) does not pass the option ----ffssttaabb to the //ssbbiinn//mmoouunntt.._t_y_p_e helpers, meaning that the alternative fstab files will be invisible for the helpers.  This is no
              problem for normal mounts, but user (non-root) mounts always require fstab to verify the user's rights.

       --tt, ----ttyyppeess _f_s_t_y_p_e
              The argument following the --tt is used to indicate the filesystem type.  The filesystem types which are currently supported depend on the running kernel.  See _/_p_r_o_c_/_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_‐
              _t_e_m_s and _/_l_i_b_/_m_o_d_u_l_e_s_/_$_(_u_n_a_m_e _-_r_)_/_k_e_r_n_e_l_/_f_s for a complete list of the filesystems.  The most common are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs, vfat, sysfs, proc, nfs and cifs.

              The programs mmoouunntt and uummoouunntt support filesystem subtypes.  The subtype is defined by a '.subtype' suffix.  For example  'fuse.sshfs'.  It's recommended to use subtype  no‐
              tation rather than add any prefix to the mount source (for example 'sshfs#example.com' is deprecated).

              If  no  --tt  option  is given, or if the aauuttoo type is specified, mount will try to guess the desired type.  Mount uses the blkid library for guessing the filesystem type; if
              that does not turn up anything that looks familiar, mount will try to read the file _/_e_t_c_/_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_s, or, if that does not exist, _/_p_r_o_c_/_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_s.  All of the  filesystem
              types  listed  there  will  be tried, except for those that are labeled "nodev" (e.g. _d_e_v_p_t_s, _p_r_o_c and _n_f_s).  If _/_e_t_c_/_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_s ends in a line with a single *, mount will
              read _/_p_r_o_c_/_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_s afterwards.  While trying, all filesystem types will be mounted with the mount option ssiilleenntt.

              The aauuttoo type may be useful for user-mounted floppies.  Creating a file _/_e_t_c_/_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_s can be useful to change the probe order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos or ext3 be‐
              fore ext2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader.

              More  than one type may be specified in a comma-separated list, for option --tt as well as in an _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b entry.  The list of filesystem types for option --tt can be prefixed
              with nnoo to specify the filesystem types on which no action should be taken.  The prefix nnoo has no effect when specified in an _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b entry.

              The prefix nnoo can be meaningful with the --aa option.  For example, the command

                     mmoouunntt --aa --tt nnoommssddooss,,ssmmbbffss

              mounts all filesystems except those of type _m_s_d_o_s and _s_m_b_f_s.

              For most types all the mmoouunntt program has to do is issue a simple mmoouunntt(2) system call, and no detailed knowledge of the filesystem type is required.  For a few  types  how‐
              ever  (like  nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) an ad hoc code is necessary.  The nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems have a separate mount program.  In order to make
              it possible to treat all types in a uniform way, mmoouunntt will execute the program //ssbbiinn//mmoouunntt.._t_y_p_e (if that exists) when called with type _t_y_p_e.  Since different  versions  of
              the ssmmbbmmoouunntt program have different calling conventions, //ssbbiinn//mmoouunntt..ssmmbbffss may have to be a shell script that sets up the desired call.

       --UU, ----uuuuiidd _u_u_i_d
              Mount the partition that has the specified _u_u_i_d.

       --vv, ----vveerrbboossee
              Verbose mode.

       --ww, ----rrww, ----rreeaadd--wwrriittee
              Mount the filesystem read/write. The read-write is kernel default.  A synonym is --oo rrww.

              Note  that  specify  --ww  on  command  line  forces mmoouunntt command to never try read-only mount on write-protected devices. The default is try read-only if the previous mount
              syscall with read-write flags failed.

       --VV, ----vveerrssiioonn
              Display version information and exit.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
              Display help text and exit.

FFIILLEESSYYSSTTEEMM--IINNDDEEPPEENNDDEENNTT MMOOUUNNTT OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Some of these options are only useful when they appear in the _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b file.

       Some of these options could be enabled or disabled by default in the system kernel.  To check the current setting see the options in /proc/mounts.  Note that filesystems also have
       per-filesystem specific default mount options (see for example ttuunnee22ffss --ll output for extN filesystems).

       The following options apply to any filesystem that is being mounted (but not every filesystem actually honors them – e.g., the ssyynncc option today has an effect only for ext2, ext3,
       ext4, fat, vfat, ufs and xfs):

       aassyynncc  All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously.  (See also the ssyynncc option.)

       aattiimmee  Do not use the nnooaattiimmee feature, so the inode access time is controlled by kernel defaults.  See also the descriptions of the rreellaattiimmee and ssttrriiccttaattiimmee mount options.

       nnooaattiimmee
              Do not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g. for faster access on the news spool to speed up news servers).  This works for all inode types (directories  too),
              so it implies nnooddiirraattiimmee.

       aauuttoo   Can be mounted with the --aa option.

       nnooaauuttoo Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the --aa option will not cause the filesystem to be mounted).

       ccoonntteexxtt==_c_o_n_t_e_x_t, ffssccoonntteexxtt==_c_o_n_t_e_x_t, ddeeffccoonntteexxtt==_c_o_n_t_e_x_t, and rroooottccoonntteexxtt==_c_o_n_t_e_x_t
              The  ccoonntteexxtt== option is useful when mounting filesystems that do not support extended attributes, such as a floppy or hard disk formatted with VFAT, or systems that are not
              normally running under SELinux, such as an ext3 or ext4 formatted

              disk from a non-SELinux workstation.  You can also use ccoonntteexxtt== on filesystems you do not trust, such as a floppy.  It also helps  in  compatibility  with  xattr-supporting
              filesystems on earlier 2.4.<x> kernel versions.  Even where xattrs are supported, you can save time not having to label every file by assigning the entire disk one security
              context.

              A commonly used option for removable media is ccoonntteexxtt==""ssyysstteemm__uu::oobbjjeecctt__rr::rreemmoovvaabbllee__tt"".

              Two other options are ffssccoonntteexxtt== and ddeeffccoonntteexxtt==, both of which are mutually exclusive of the context option.  This means you can use fscontext  and  defcontext  with  each
              other, but neither can be used with context.

              The  ffssccoonntteexxtt== option works for all filesystems, regardless of their xattr support.  The fscontext option sets the overarching filesystem label to a specific security con‐
              text.  This filesystem label is separate from the individual labels on the files.  It represents the entire filesystem for certain kinds of permission checks, such as  dur‐
              ing mount or file creation.  Individual file labels are still obtained from the xattrs on the files themselves.  The context option actually sets the aggregate context that
              fscontext provides, in addition to supplying the same label for individual files.

              You can set the default security context for unlabeled files using ddeeffccoonntteexxtt== option.  This overrides the value set for unlabeled  files  in  the  policy  and  requires  a
              filesystem that supports xattr labeling.

              The rroooottccoonntteexxtt== option allows you to explicitly label the root inode of a FS being mounted before that FS or inode becomes visible to userspace.  This was found to be use‐
              ful for things like stateless linux.

              Note that the kernel rejects any remount request that includes the context option, eevveenn when unchanged from the current context.

       ddeeffaauullttss
              Use the default options: rrww, ssuuiidd, ddeevv, eexxeecc, aauuttoo, nnoouusseerr, and aassyynncc.

              Note that the real set of all default mount options depends on kernel and filesystem type.  See the beginning of this section for more details.

       ddeevv    Interpret character or block special devices on the filesystem.

       nnooddeevv  Do not interpret character or block special devices on the file system.

       ddiirraattiimmee
              Update directory inode access times on this filesystem.  This is the default.  (This option is ignored when nnooaattiimmee is set.)

       nnooddiirraattiimmee
              Do not update directory inode access times on this filesystem.  (This option is implied when nnooaattiimmee is set.)

       ddiirrssyynncc
              All  directory  updates  within the filesystem should be done synchronously.  This affects the following system calls: creat, link, unlink, symlink, mkdir, rmdir, mknod and
              rename.

       eexxeecc   Permit execution of binaries.

       nnooeexxeecc Do not permit direct execution of any binaries on the mounted filesystem.

       ggrroouupp  Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem if one of that user's groups matches the group of the device.  This option implies the options nnoossuuiidd and nnooddeevv (unless over‐
              ridden by subsequent options, as in the option line ggrroouupp,,ddeevv,,ssuuiidd).

       iivveerrssiioonn
              Every time the inode is modified, the i_version field will be incremented.

       nnooiivveerrssiioonn
              Do not increment the i_version inode field.

       mmaanndd   Allow mandatory locks on this filesystem.  See ffccnnttll(2).

       nnoommaanndd Do not allow mandatory locks on this filesystem.

       __nneettddeevv
              The filesystem resides on a device that requires network access (used to prevent the system from attempting to mount these filesystems until the network has been enabled on
              the system).

       nnooffaaiill Do not report errors for this device if it does not exist.

       rreellaattiimmee
              Update inode access times relative to modify or change time.  Access time is only updated if the previous access time was earlier than the current modify  or  change  time.
              (Similar to nnooaattiimmee, but it doesn't break mmuutttt or other applications that need to know if a file has been read since the last time it was modified.)

              Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior provided by this option (unless nnooaattiimmee was specified), and the ssttrriiccttaattiimmee option is required to obtain traditional
              semantics.  In addition, since Linux 2.6.30, the file's last access time is always updated if it is more than 1 day old.

       nnoorreellaattiimmee
              Do not use the rreellaattiimmee feature.  See also the ssttrriiccttaattiimmee mount option.

       ssttrriiccttaattiimmee
              Allows to explicitly request full atime updates.  This makes it possible for the kernel to default to rreellaattiimmee or nnooaattiimmee but still allow userspace  to  override  it.   For
              more details about the default system mount options see /proc/mounts.

       nnoossttrriiccttaattiimmee
              Use the kernel's default behavior for inode access time updates.

       llaazzyyttiimmee
              Only update times (atime, mtime, ctime) on the in-memory version of the file inode.

              This mount option significantly reduces writes to the inode table for workloads that perform frequent random writes to preallocated files.

              The on-disk timestamps are updated only when:

              - the inode needs to be updated for some change unrelated to file timestamps

              - the application employs ffssyynncc(2), ssyynnccffss(2), or ssyynncc(2)

              - an undeleted inode is evicted from memory

              - more than 24 hours have passed since the i-node was written to disk.

       nnoollaazzyyttiimmee
              Do not use the lazytime feature.

       ssuuiidd   Honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file capabilities when executing programs from this filesystem.

       nnoossuuiidd Do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file capabilities when executing programs from this filesystem.

       ssiilleenntt Turn on the silent flag.

       lloouudd   Turn off the silent flag.

       oowwnneerr  Allow  an  ordinary user to mount the filesystem if that user is the owner of the device.  This option implies the options nnoossuuiidd and nnooddeevv (unless overridden by subsequent
              options, as in the option line oowwnneerr,,ddeevv,,ssuuiidd).

       rreemmoouunntt
              Attempt to remount an already-mounted filesystem.  This is commonly used to change the mount flags for a filesystem, especially to make a readonly filesystem writable.   It
              does not change device or mount point.

              The remount operation together with the bbiinndd flag has special semantic. See above, the subsection BBiinndd mmoouunnttss.

              The  remount functionality follows the standard way the mount command works with options from fstab.  This means that mmoouunntt does not read fstab (or mtab) only when both _d_e_‐
              _v_i_c_e and _d_i_r are specified.

                  mmoouunntt --oo rreemmoouunntt,,rrww //ddeevv//ffoooo //ddiirr

              After this call all old mount options are replaced and arbitrary stuff from fstab (or mtab) is ignored, except the loop= option which is internally generated and maintained
              by the mount command.

                  mmoouunntt --oo rreemmoouunntt,,rrww  //ddiirr

              After  this  call, mount reads fstab and merges these options with the options from the command line (--oo).  If no mountpoint is found in fstab, then a remount with unspeci‐
              fied source is allowed.

              mount(8) allows to use ----aallll to remount all already mounted filesystems which match a specified filter (--OO and --tt).  For example:

                  mmoouunntt ----aallll --oo rreemmoouunntt,,rroo --tt vvffaatt

              remounts all already mounted vfat filesystems in read-only mode. The each of the filesystems is remounted by "mount -o remount,ro /dir" semantic. It means the mount command
              reads fstab or mtab and merges these options with the options from the command line.

       rroo     Mount the filesystem read-only.

       rrww     Mount the filesystem read-write.

       ssyynncc   All  I/O  to  the  filesystem  should be done synchronously.  In the case of media with a limited number of write cycles (e.g. some flash drives), ssyynncc may cause life-cycle
              shortening.

       uusseerr   Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem.  The name of the mounting user is written to the mtab file (or to the private libmount file in /run/mount on systems without
              a  regular  mtab)  so  that this same user can unmount the filesystem again.  This option implies the options nnooeexxeecc, nnoossuuiidd, and nnooddeevv (unless overridden by subsequent op‐
              tions, as in the option line uusseerr,,eexxeecc,,ddeevv,,ssuuiidd).

       nnoouusseerr Forbid an ordinary user to mount the filesystem.  This is the default; it does not imply any other options.

       uusseerrss  Allow any user to mount and to unmount the filesystem, even when some other ordinary user mounted it.  This option implies the options nnooeexxeecc,  nnoossuuiidd,  and  nnooddeevv  (unless
              overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line uusseerrss,,eexxeecc,,ddeevv,,ssuuiidd).

       XX--**    All  options  prefixed with "X-" are interpreted as comments or as userspace application-specific options.  These options are not stored in the user space (e.g. mtab file),
              nor sent to the mount._t_y_p_e helpers nor to the mmoouunntt(2) system call.  The suggested format is XX--_a_p_p_n_a_m_e._o_p_t_i_o_n.

       xx--**    The same as XX--** options, but stored permanently in the user space. It means the options are also available for umount or another operations.  Note that maintain  mount  op‐
              tions in user space is tricky, because it's necessary use libmount based tools and there is no guarantee that the options will be always available (for example after a move
              mount operation or in unshared namespace).

              Note that before util-linux v2.30 the x-* options have not been maintained by libmount and stored in user space (functionality was the same as have X-*  now),  but  due  to
              growing number of use-cases (in initrd, systemd etc.) the functionality have been extended to keep existing fstab configurations usable without a change.

       XX--mmoouunntt..mmkkddiirr[==_m_o_d_e]]
              Allow  to  make  a target directory (mountpoint).  The optional argument _m_o_d_e specifies the filesystem access mode used for mmkkddiirr(2) in octal notation.  The default mode is
              0755.  This functionality is supported only for root users.  The option is also supported as x-mount.mkdir, this notation is deprecated for mount.mkdir since v2.30.

       You should consult the respective man page for the filesystem first.  If you want to know what options the ext4 filesystem supports, then check the  eexxtt44(5)  man  page.   If  that
       doesn't exist, you can also check the corresponding mount page like mmoouunntt..cciiffss(8).  Note that you might have to install the respective userland tools.

       The following options apply only to certain filesystems.  We sort them by filesystem.  They all follow the --oo flag.

       What options are supported depends a bit on the running kernel.  More info may be found in the kernel source subdirectory _D_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n_/_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_s.

       The devpts filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted on _/_d_e_v_/_p_t_s.  In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens _/_d_e_v_/_p_t_m_x; the number of the pseudo termi‐
       nal is then made available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as _/_d_e_v_/_p_t_s_/<number>.

       uuiidd==_v_a_l_u_e and ggiidd==_v_a_l_u_e
              This  sets  the  owner  or the group of newly created PTYs to the specified values.  When nothing is specified, they will be set to the UID and GID of the creating process.
              For example, if there is a tty group with GID 5, then ggiidd==55 will cause newly created PTYs to belong to the tty group.

       mmooddee==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set the mode of newly created PTYs to the specified value.  The default is 0600.  A value of mmooddee==662200 and ggiidd==55 makes "mesg y" the default on newly created PTYs.

       nneewwiinnssttaannccee
              Create a private instance of devpts filesystem, such that indices of ptys allocated in this new instance are independent of indices created in other instances of devpts.

              All mounts of devpts without this nneewwiinnssttaannccee option share the same set of pty indices (i.e. legacy mode).  Each mount of devpts with the nneewwiinnssttaannccee option has  a  private
              set of pty indices.

              This option is mainly used to support containers in the linux kernel.  It is implemented in linux kernel versions starting with 2.6.29.  Further, this mount option is valid
              only if CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES is enabled in the kernel configuration.

              To use this option effectively, _/_d_e_v_/_p_t_m_x must be a symbolic link to _p_t_s_/_p_t_m_x_.  See _D_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n_/_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_s_/_d_e_v_p_t_s_._t_x_t in the linux kernel source tree for details.

       ppttmmxxmmooddee==_v_a_l_u_e

              Set the mode for the new _p_t_m_x device node in the devpts filesystem.

              With the support for multiple instances of devpts (see nneewwiinnssttaannccee option above), each instance has a private _p_t_m_x node in the root  of  the  devpts  filesystem  (typically
              _/_d_e_v_/_p_t_s_/_p_t_m_x).

              For  compatibility  with  older versions of the kernel, the default mode of the new _p_t_m_x node is 0000.  ppttmmxxmmooddee==_v_a_l_u_e specifies a more useful mode for the _p_t_m_x node and is
              highly recommended when the nneewwiinnssttaannccee option is specified.

              This option is only implemented in linux kernel versions starting with 2.6.29.  Further, this option is valid only if CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES  is  enabled  in  the
              kernel configuration.

   MMoouunntt ooppttiioonnss ffoorr ffaatt
       (Note: _f_a_t is not a separate filesystem, but a common part of the _m_s_d_o_s, _u_m_s_d_o_s and _v_f_a_t filesystems.)

       bblloocckkssiizzee=={551122|11002244|22004488}
              Set blocksize (default 512).  This option is obsolete.

       uuiidd==_v_a_l_u_e and ggiidd==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set the owner and group of all files.  (Default: the UID and GID of the current process.)

       uummaasskk==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that are nnoott present).  The default is the umask of the current process.  The value is given in octal.

       ddmmaasskk==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set the umask applied to directories only.  The default is the umask of the current process.  The value is given in octal.

       ffmmaasskk==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set the umask applied to regular files only.  The default is the umask of the current process.  The value is given in octal.

       aallllooww__uuttiimmee==_v_a_l_u_e
              This option controls the permission check of mtime/atime.

              2200     If current process is in group of file's group ID, you can change timestamp.

              22      Other users can change timestamp.

              The default is set from `dmask' option. (If the directory is writable, uuttiimmee(2) is also allowed.  I.e. ~dmask & 022)

              Normally uuttiimmee(2) checks current process is owner of the file, or it has CAP_FOWNER capability.  But FAT filesystem doesn't have UID/GID on disk, so normal check is too in‐
              flexible.  With this option you can relax it.

       cchheecckk==_v_a_l_u_e
              Three different levels of pickiness can be chosen:

              rr[eellaaxxeedd]
                     Upper and lower case are accepted and equivalent, long name parts are truncated (e.g. _v_e_r_y_l_o_n_g_n_a_m_e_._f_o_o_b_a_r becomes _v_e_r_y_l_o_n_g_._f_o_o), leading and embedded spaces are  ac‐
                     cepted in each name part (name and extension).

              nn[oorrmmaall]
                     Like "relaxed", but many special characters (*, ?, <, spaces, etc.) are rejected.  This is the default.

              ss[ttrriicctt]
                     Like "normal", but names that contain long parts or special characters that are sometimes used on Linux but are not accepted by MS-DOS (+, =, etc.) are rejected.

       ccooddeeppaaggee==_v_a_l_u_e
              Sets the codepage for converting to shortname characters on FAT and VFAT filesystems.  By default, codepage 437 is used.

       ccoonnvv==_m_o_d_e
              This option is obsolete and may fail or being ignored.

       ccvvff__ffoorrmmaatt==_m_o_d_u_l_e
              Forces the driver to use the CVF (Compressed Volume File) module cvf__m_o_d_u_l_e instead of auto-detection.  If the kernel supports kmod, the cvf_format=xxx option also controls
              on-demand CVF module loading.  This option is obsolete.

       ccvvff__ooppttiioonn==_o_p_t_i_o_n
              Option passed to the CVF module.  This option is obsolete.

       ddeebbuugg  Turn on the _d_e_b_u_g flag.  A version string and a list of filesystem parameters will be printed (these data are also printed if the parameters appear to be inconsistent).

       ddiissccaarrdd
              If set, causes discard/TRIM commands to be issued to the block device when blocks are freed.  This is useful for SSD devices and sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs.

       ddooss11xxffllooppppyy
              If set, use a fallback default BIOS Parameter Block configuration, determined by backing device size.  These static parameters match defaults assumed by  DOS  1.x  for  160
              kiB, 180 kiB, 320 kiB, and 360 kiB floppies and floppy images.

       eerrrroorrss=={ppaanniicc|ccoonnttiinnuuee|rreemmoouunntt--rroo}
              Specify FAT behavior on critical errors: panic, continue without doing anything, or remount the partition in read-only mode (default behavior).

       ffaatt=={1122|1166|3322}
              Specify a 12, 16 or 32 bit fat.  This overrides the automatic FAT type detection routine.  Use with caution!

       iioocchhaarrsseett==_v_a_l_u_e
              Character set to use for converting between 8 bit characters and 16 bit Unicode characters.  The default is iso8859-1.  Long filenames are stored on disk in Unicode format.

       nnffss=={ssttaallee__rrww|nnoossttaallee__rroo}
              Enable this only if you want to export the FAT filesystem over NFS.

              ssttaallee__rrww:  This option maintains an index (cache) of directory inodes which is used by the nfs-related code to improve look-ups.  Full file operations (read/write) over NFS
              are supported but with cache eviction at NFS server, this could result in spurious EESSTTAALLEE errors.

              nnoossttaallee__rroo: This option bases the inode number and file handle on the on-disk location of a file in the FAT directory entry.  This ensures that EESSTTAALLEE will not be  returned
              after  a  file is evicted from the inode cache.  However, it means that operations such as rename, create and unlink could cause file handles that previously pointed at one
              file to point at a different file, potentially causing data corruption.  For this reason, this option also mounts the filesystem readonly.

              To maintain backward compatibility, '-o nfs' is also accepted, defaulting to ssttaallee__rrww.

       ttzz==UUTTCC This option disables the conversion of timestamps between local time (as used by Windows on FAT) and UTC (which Linux uses internally).  This is  particularly  useful  when
              mounting devices (like digital cameras) that are set to UTC in order to avoid the pitfalls of local time.

       ttiimmee__ooffffsseett==_m_i_n_u_t_e_s
              Set  offset  for  conversion of timestamps from local time used by FAT to UTC.  I.e., _m_i_n_u_t_e_s will be subtracted from each timestamp to convert it to UTC used internally by
              Linux.  This is useful when the time zone set in the kernel via sseettttiimmeeooffddaayy(2) is not the time zone used by the filesystem.  Note that this option still does  not  provide
              correct time stamps in all cases in presence of DST - time stamps in a different DST setting will be off by one hour.

       qquuiieett  Turn on the _q_u_i_e_t flag.  Attempts to chown or chmod files do not return errors, although they fail.  Use with caution!

       rrooddiirr  FAT has the ATTR_RO (read-only) attribute.  On Windows, the ATTR_RO of the directory will just be ignored, and is used only by applications as a flag (e.g. it's set for the
              customized folder).

              If you want to use ATTR_RO as read-only flag even for the directory, set this option.

       sshhoowweexxeecc
              If set, the execute permission bits of the file will be allowed only if the extension part of the name is .EXE, .COM, or .BAT.  Not set by default.

       ssyyss__iimmmmuuttaabbllee
              If set, ATTR_SYS attribute on FAT is handled as IMMUTABLE flag on Linux.  Not set by default.

       fflluusshh  If set, the filesystem will try to flush to disk more early than normal.  Not set by default.

       uusseeffrreeee
              Use the "free clusters" value stored on FSINFO.  It'll be used to determine number of free clusters without scanning disk.  But it's not used  by  default,  because  recent
              Windows don't update it correctly in some case.  If you are sure the "free clusters" on FSINFO is correct, by this option you can avoid scanning disk.

       ddoottss, nnooddoottss, ddoottssOOKK==[yyeess|nnoo]
              Various misguided attempts to force Unix or DOS conventions onto a FAT filesystem.

       uuiidd==_n,, ggiidd==_n

              Set the umask used for all directories, all regular files, or all files and directories.  Defaults to the umask of the current process.

       sseessssiioonn==_n
              Select the CDROM session to mount.  Defaults to leaving that decision to the CDROM driver.  This option will fail with anything but a CDROM as underlying device.

       ppaarrtt==_n Select partition number n from the device.  Only makes sense for CDROMs.  Defaults to not parsing the partition table at all.

       qquuiieett  Don't complain about invalid mount options.

       uummaasskk==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that are nnoott present).  The default is the umask of the current process.  The value is given in octal.

       ccaassee=={lloowweerr|aassiiss}
              Convert all files names to lower case, or leave them.  (Default: ccaassee==lloowweerr.)

       ccoonnvv==_m_o_d_e

   MMoouunntt ooppttiioonnss ffoorr iissoo99666600
       ISO 9660 is a standard describing a filesystem structure to be used on CD-ROMs. (This filesystem type is also seen on some DVDs.  See also the _u_d_f filesystem.)

       Normal  _i_s_o_9_6_6_0  filenames  appear in an 8.3 format (i.e., DOS-like restrictions on filename length), and in addition all characters are in upper case.  Also there is no field for
       file ownership, protection, number of links, provision for block/character devices, etc.

       Rock Ridge is an extension to iso9660 that provides all of these UNIX-like features.  Basically there are extensions to each directory record that supply all of the additional in‐
       formation, and when Rock Ridge is in use, the filesystem is indistinguishable from a normal UNIX filesystem (except that it is read-only, of course).

       nnoorroocckk Disable the use of Rock Ridge extensions, even if available.  Cf. mmaapp.

       nnoojjoolliieett
              Disable the use of Microsoft Joliet extensions, even if available.  Cf. mmaapp.

       cchheecckk=={rr[eellaaxxeedd]|ss[ttrriicctt]}
              With  cchheecckk==rreellaaxxeedd,  a filename is first converted to lower case before doing the lookup.  This is probably only meaningful together with nnoorroocckk and mmaapp==nnoorrmmaall.  (Default:
              cchheecckk==ssttrriicctt.)

       uuiidd==_v_a_l_u_e and ggiidd==_v_a_l_u_e
              Give all files in the filesystem the indicated user or group id, possibly overriding the information found in the Rock Ridge extensions.  (Default: uuiidd==00,,ggiidd==00.)

       mmaapp=={nn[oorrmmaall]|oo[ffff]|aa[ccoorrnn]}
              For non-Rock Ridge volumes, normal name translation maps upper to lower case ASCII, drops a trailing `;1', and converts `;' to `.'.  With mmaapp==ooffff  no  name  translation  is
              done.  See nnoorroocckk.  (Default: mmaapp==nnoorrmmaall.)  mmaapp==aaccoorrnn is like mmaapp==nnoorrmmaall but also apply Acorn extensions if present.

       mmooddee==_v_a_l_u_e
              For non-Rock Ridge volumes, give all files the indicated mode.  (Default: read and execute permission for everybody.)  Octal mode values require a leading 0.

       uunnhhiiddee Also show hidden and associated files.  (If the ordinary files and the associated or hidden files have the same filenames, this may make the ordinary files inaccessible.)

       bblloocckk=={551122|11002244|22004488}
              Set the block size to the indicated value.  (Default: bblloocckk==11002244.)

       ccoonnvv==_m_o_d_e
              This option is obsolete and may fail or being ignored.

       ccrruufftt  If  the  high  byte  of  the file length contains other garbage, set this mount option to ignore the high order bits of the file length.  This implies that a file cannot be
              larger than 16 MB.

       sseessssiioonn==_x
              Select number of session on multisession CD.

       ssbbsseeccttoorr==_x_x_x
              Session begins from sector xxx.

       The following options are the same as for vfat and specifying them only makes sense when using discs encoded using Microsoft's Joliet extensions.

       iioocchhaarrsseett==_v_a_l_u_e
              Character set to use for converting 16 bit Unicode characters on CD to 8 bit characters.  The default is iso8859-1.

       uuttff88   Convert 16 bit Unicode characters on CD to UTF-8.

              Character set to use for converting from Unicode to ASCII.  The default is to do no conversion.  Use iioocchhaarrsseett==uuttff88 for UTF8 translations.  This requires CONFIG_NLS_UTF8 to
              be set in the kernel _._c_o_n_f_i_g file.

       rreessiizzee==_v_a_l_u_e
              Resize  the  volume  to  _v_a_l_u_e  blocks.  JFS only supports growing a volume, not shrinking it.  This option is only valid during a remount, when the volume is mounted read-

              Do not write to the journal.  The primary use of this option is to allow for higher performance when restoring a volume from backup media.  The integrity of the  volume  is
              not guaranteed if the system abnormally ends.

       iinntteeggrriittyy
              Default.   Commit metadata changes to the journal.  Use this option to remount a volume where the nnooiinntteeggrriittyy option was previously specified in order to restore normal be‐

       See mount options for fat.  If the _m_s_d_o_s filesystem detects an inconsistency, it reports an error and sets the file system read-only.  The filesystem can be made writable again by

       Since Linux 3.18 the overlay pseudo filesystem implements a union mount for other filesystems.

       An overlay filesystem combines two filesystems - an uuppppeerr filesystem and a lloowweerr filesystem.  When a name exists in both filesystems, the object in the upper filesystem is visible
       while the object in the lower filesystem is either hidden or, in the case of directories, merged with the upper object.

       The lower filesystem can be any filesystem supported by Linux and does not need to be writable.  The lower filesystem can even be another overlayfs.   The  upper  filesystem  will
       normally be writable and if it is it must support the creation of trusted.* extended attributes, and must provide a valid d_type in readdir responses, so NFS is not suitable.

       A read-only overlay of two read-only filesystems may use any filesystem type.  The options lloowweerrddiirr and uuppppeerrddiirr are combined into a merged directory by using:

              mmoouunntt --tt oovveerrllaayy  oovveerrllaayy  \\

       lloowweerrddiirr==_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Any filesystem, does not need to be on a writable filesystem.

       uuppppeerrddiirr==_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              The upperdir is normally on a writable filesystem.

       Reiserfs is a journaling filesystem.

       ccoonnvv   Instructs  version  3.6  reiserfs  software to mount a version 3.5 filesystem, using the 3.6 format for newly created objects.  This filesystem will no longer be compatible
              with reiserfs 3.5 tools.

       hhaasshh=={rruuppaassoovv|tteeaa|rr55|ddeetteecctt}
              Choose which hash function reiserfs will use to find files within directories.

              rruuppaassoovv
                     A hash invented by Yury Yu. Rupasov.  It is fast and preserves locality, mapping lexicographically close file names to close hash values.  This option should not  be
                     used, as it causes a high probability of hash collisions.

              tteeaa    A Davis-Meyer function implemented by Jeremy Fitzhardinge.  It uses hash permuting bits in the name.  It gets high randomness and, therefore, low probability of hash
                     collisions at some CPU cost.  This may be used if EHASHCOLLISION errors are experienced with the r5 hash.

              rr55     A modified version of the rupasov hash.  It is used by default and is the best choice unless the filesystem has huge directories and unusual file-name patterns.

              ddeetteecctt Instructs _m_o_u_n_t to detect which hash function is in use by examining the filesystem being mounted, and to write this information into the reiserfs superblock.   This
                     is only useful on the first mount of an old format filesystem.

              Tunes the block allocator.  This may provide performance improvements in some situations.

       nnoobboorrddeerr
              Disable the border allocator algorithm invented by Yury Yu. Rupasov.  This may provide performance improvements in some situations.

       nnoolloogg  Disable  journaling.   This will provide slight performance improvements in some situations at the cost of losing reiserfs's fast recovery from crashes.  Even with this op‐
              tion turned on, reiserfs still performs all journaling operations, save for actual writes into its journaling area.  Implementation of _n_o_l_o_g is a work in progress.

       nnoottaaiill By default, reiserfs stores small files and `file tails' directly into its tree.  This confuses some utilities such as LLIILLOO(8).  This option is used to disable  packing  of

       rreessiizzee==_n_u_m_b_e_r
              A  remount  option  which permits online expansion of reiserfs partitions.  Instructs reiserfs to assume that the device has _n_u_m_b_e_r blocks.  This option is designed for use
              with devices which are under logical volume management (LVM).  There is a special _r_e_s_i_z_e_r utility which can be obtained from _f_t_p_:_/_/_f_t_p_._n_a_m_e_s_y_s_._c_o_m_/_p_u_b_/_r_e_i_s_e_r_f_s_p_r_o_g_s.

              This disables / enables the use of write barriers in the journaling code.  barrier=none disables, barrier=flush enables (default).  This also requires an IO stack which can
              support  barriers, and if reiserfs gets an error on a barrier write, it will disable barriers again with a warning.  Write barriers enforce proper on-disk ordering of jour‐
              nal commits, making volatile disk write caches safe to use, at some performance penalty.  If your disks are battery-backed in one way or  another,  disabling  barriers  may
              safely improve performance.

       The following mount options are available:

       bbuullkk__rreeaadd
              Enable  bulk-read.   VFS read-ahead is disabled because it slows down the file system.  Bulk-Read is an internal optimization.  Some flashes may read faster if the data are
              read at one go, rather than at several read requests.  For example, OneNAND can do "read-while-load" if it reads more than one NAND page.

       nnoo__bbuullkk__rreeaadd
              Do not bulk-read.  This is the default.

              Do not check data CRC-32 checksums.  With this option, the filesystem does not check CRC-32 checksum for data, but it does check it for the internal  indexing  information.
              This option only affects reading, not writing.  CRC-32 is always calculated when writing the data.

              option,  a  '?' is used when no translation is possible.  The escape character is ':' because it is otherwise invalid on the vfat filesystem.  The escape sequence that gets
              used, where u is the Unicode character, is: ':', (u & 0x3f), ((u>>6) & 0x3f), (u>>12).

       ppoossiixx  Allow two files with names that only differ in case.  This option is obsolete.

       nnoonnuummttaaiill
              First try to make a short name without sequence number, before trying _n_a_m_e_~_n_u_m_._e_x_t.

       uuttff88   UTF8 is the filesystem safe 8-bit encoding of Unicode that is used by the console.  It can be enabled for the filesystem with this option or disabled with  utf8=0,  utf8=no
              or utf8=false.  If `uni_xlate' gets set, UTF8 gets disabled.

       sshhoorrttnnaammee==_m_o_d_e
              Defines  the  behavior  for creation and display of filenames which fit into 8.3 characters.  If a long name for a file exists, it will always be the preferred one for dis‐
              play.  There are four _m_o_d_es:

              lloowweerr  Force the short name to lower case upon display; store a long name when the short name is not all upper case.

              wwiinn9955  Force the short name to upper case upon display; store a long name when the short name is not all upper case.

              wwiinnnntt  Display the short name as is; store a long name when the short name is not all lower case or all upper case.

              mmiixxeedd  Display the short name as is; store a long name when the short name is not all upper case.  This mode is the default since Linux 2.6.32.

              Set the owner and group and mode of the device files in the usbfs filesystem (default: uid=gid=0, mode=0644).  The mode is given in octal.

       bbuussuuiidd==_u_i_d and bbuussggiidd==_g_i_d and bbuussmmooddee==_m_o_d_e
              Set the owner and group and mode of the bus directories in the usbfs filesystem (default: uid=gid=0, mode=0555).  The mode is given in octal.

TTHHEE LLOOOOPP DDEEVVIICCEE
       One further possible type is a mount via the loop device.  For example, the command

              mmoouunntt //ttmmpp//ddiisskk..iimmgg //mmnntt --tt vvffaatt --oo lloooopp==//ddeevv//lloooopp33

       will set up the loop device _/_d_e_v_/_l_o_o_p_3 to correspond to the file _/_t_m_p_/_d_i_s_k_._i_m_g, and then mount this device on _/_m_n_t.

       If no explicit loop device is mentioned (but just an option `--oo lloooopp' is given), then mmoouunntt will try to find some unused loop device and use that, for example

              mmoouunntt //ttmmpp//ddiisskk..iimmgg //mmnntt --oo lloooopp

       The mount command aauuttoommaattiiccaallllyy creates a loop device from a regular file if a filesystem type is not specified or the filesystem is known for libblkid, for example:

              mmoouunntt //ttmmpp//ddiisskk..iimmgg //mmnntt

              mmoouunntt --tt eexxtt44 //ttmmpp//ddiisskk..iimmgg //mmnntt

       This type of mount knows about three options, namely lloooopp, ooffffsseett and ssiizzeelliimmiitt, that are really options to lloosseettuupp(8).  (These options can be used in addition to  those  specific
       to the filesystem type.)

       Since Linux 2.6.25 auto-destruction of loop devices is supported, meaning that any loop device allocated by mmoouunntt will be freed by uummoouunntt independently of _/_e_t_c_/_m_t_a_b.

       You can also free a loop device by hand, using lloosseettuupp --dd or uummoouunntt --dd.

       Since util-linux v2.29 mount command re-uses the loop device rather than initialize a new device if the same backing file is already used for some loop device with the same offset
       and sizelimit. This is necessary to avoid a filesystem corruption.

       mmoouunntt has the following return codes (the bits can be ORed):

       The syntax of external mount helpers is:

           //ssbbiinn//mmoouunntt.._s_u_f_f_i_x _s_p_e_c _d_i_r [--ssffnnvv] [--NN _n_a_m_e_s_p_a_c_e] [--oo _o_p_t_i_o_n_s] [--tt _t_y_p_e.._s_u_b_t_y_p_e]

       where the _s_u_f_f_i_x is the filesystem type and the --ssffnnvvooNN options have the same meaning as the normal mount options.  The --tt option is used for  filesystems  with  subtypes  support
       (for example //ssbbiinn//mmoouunntt..ffuussee --tt ffuussee..sssshhffss).

       The  command  mmoouunntt  does not pass the mount options uunnbbiinnddaabbllee, rruunnbbiinnddaabbllee, pprriivvaattee, rrpprriivvaattee, ssllaavvee, rrssllaavvee, sshhaarreedd, rrsshhaarreedd, aauuttoo, nnooaauuttoo, ccoommmmeenntt, xx--**, lloooopp, ooffffsseett and ssiizzee‐‐

BBUUGGSS
       It is possible for a corrupted filesystem to cause a crash.

       Some Linux filesystems don't support --oo ssyynncc nor --oo ddiirrssyynncc (the ext2, ext3, ext4, fat and vfat filesystems _d_o support synchronous updates (a la BSD) when mounted  with  the  ssyynncc
       option).

       The --oo rreemmoouunntt may not be able to change mount parameters (all _e_x_t_2_f_s-specific parameters, except ssbb, are changeable with a remount, for example, but you can't change ggiidd or uummaasskk
       for the _f_a_t_f_s).

       It is possible that the files _/_e_t_c_/_m_t_a_b and _/_p_r_o_c_/_m_o_u_n_t_s don't match on systems with a regular mtab file.  The first file is based only on the mount command options, but the  con‐
       tent  of  the second file also depends on the kernel and others settings (e.g. on a remote NFS server -- in certain cases the mount command may report unreliable information about
       an NFS mount point and the /proc/mounts file usually contains more reliable information.)  This is another reason to replace the mtab file with a symlink to the _/_p_r_o_c_/_m_o_u_n_t_s file.

       Checking files on NFS filesystems referenced by file descriptors (i.e. the ffccnnttll and iiooccttll families of functions) may lead to inconsistent results due to the lack of a consistency
       check in the kernel even if noac is used.

       The  lloooopp  option with the ooffffsseett or ssiizzeelliimmiitt options used may fail when using older kernels if the mmoouunntt command can't confirm that the size of the block device has been config‐
       ured as requested.  This situation can be worked around by using the lloosseettuupp command manually before calling mmoouunntt with the configured loop device.
